    "Before running this ipynb file, you should download the training and testing data. Please go to https://www.kaggle.com/c/ift3395-6390-f2018, download 4 data files: `train_images.npy`, `train_labels.csv`, `test_images.npy`, and `sample_submission.csv`, create a new folder named \"input\" in the directory where this .ipynb file is, and put the 4 files into the folder created.\n",

    " - matplotlib 2.2.0, \n",
    " - torchvision 0.2.1\n",

    "- Support for Codes Running on Colab with GPU\n",
    "- Necessary Modules & Basic Tool Functions\n",
    "- Loading Original Data\n",

    "From the thrid section until to the end of the file, we built our codes by first implementing some methods, then use some codes to test and show the outputs of the methods to make sure these methods are well functioned. A global bool variant `SHOW_DEMO` is used to open or close these code blocks which is somehow like:\n",

    "We recommend you set `SHOW_DEMO = True` for the first time running this ipynb, such that you have a good understanding of the role of each method we implemented. After you have a clear idea of all the methods, you may use `SHOW_DEMO = False` to skip all check codes, focus on the first cell in the section: **Training Models**, select `run before` in your notebook menus, and start one of the most exciting parts of the ipynb: training the best model we built for the competition.\n",
